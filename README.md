# fuck [![WTFPL][license-badge]](LICENSE)

fuck is a batch file, inspired by a [@lindseybieda](https://twitter.com/lindseybieda) [tweet](https://twitter.com/lindseybieda/status/767807738562871296), inspired by [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/), that reminds you that no fucks are given.

## requirements

a win32 machine :computer: capable of running a fucking batch file 

## usage

place the fuck.bat file wherever the fuck you want to run it :fu: :fu: 

## optional

for the best command line experience with fuck, i recommend placing fuck.bat in a file directory location that is also in your PATH environment variable; or putting fuck.bat in your C:\Windows\System32 folder should also work. :page_facing_up:

:clap: :clap: :clap:

## how it works

fuck simply reminds you that no fucks are given :smile:

## caveats

this has no other fancy features like [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/).
